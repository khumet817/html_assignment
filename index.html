<!-- Below is a basic introduction explaining what a science fiction movie is and what a tech talk is -->

        Science fiction film (or sci-fi film) is a genre that uses speculative, fictional science-based depictions 
        of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms, alien worlds, 
        extrasensory perception and time travel, along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft, robots, cyborgs, 
        interstellar travel or other technologies. Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or 
        social issues, and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition. In many cases, tropes derived from 
        written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific 
        plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held. Tech talks are short presentations 
        with community question and answer sessions. They are usually under an hour in length and focus on a specific technical topic.

        <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/07/09/tidy-html5-replacement/">Evolving the MediaWiki platform: Why we replaced Tidy with a HTML5 parser

    </h2> 

        <p>
            We've replaced Tidy, a tool that fixes HTML errors, with a HTML5-based tool. Given a HTML5 library, replacing Tidy is pretty straightforward, but it took us 
            three years to finally flip the switch. In this blog post, we'll explore how the time was spent which also throws light on the complexities of making changes 
            to certain pieces of the technical infrastructure powering Wikimedia wikis.

                <br><br>

            This switch was a collaborative effort between the Parsing, Platform, Community Liaison teams and other individuals (from the Product side) at the Wikimedia 
            Foundation and volunteer editing communities on various wikis. Everyone involved played important and specific roles in getting us to this important milestone. 
            In this post, the authors use "we" as a narrative convenience to refer to some subgroup of people above.

            First: Some background

                <br><br>

            What is Tidy?

                <br><br>

            Tidy is a library that fixes HTML markup errors, among other things. It was developed in the 1990s when HTML4 was the standard and different browsers did not deal 
            with ill-formed HTML markup identically leading to cross-browser rendering differences.
                
                <br><br>

            Badly formed markup is common on wiki pages when editors use HTML tags in templates and on the page itself. (Example: unclosed HTML tags, such as a <small> without a </small>, 
            are common). In some cases, MediaWiki itself introduces HTML errors. In order to deal with this, Tidy was introduced into MediaWiki around 2004 to ensure the output of MediaWiki 
            was well-formed HTML and to ensure it renders identically across different browsers... (CLICK ON IMAGE TO READ MORE)

            The 10th anniversary Apple iPhone is here, and it's called the iPhone X (pronounced "iPhone Ten"). The Cupertino, California-based company made it official at an event on the 
            Apple Campus in the Steve Jobs Theater — and in our iPhone X review, we call it "the best iPhone ever." Indeed, Apple CEO Tim Cook called the new iPhone X "the biggest leap forward 
            since the original iPhone," and it’s easy to see why. The OLED display — an iPhone first — is called the Super Retina Display and measures 5.8 inches, with a resolution of 2,436 × 
            1,125 pixels. It features Dolby Vision and HDR10 for stunning high-contrast video playback, as well as TrueTone dynamic white-balance adjustment, a feature of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 
            and the new iPhone 8 models... (CLICK ON IMAGE TO READ MORE)

            Those updates weren't always smooth – though on PS3, they were always happening – but it's easy to see just how far the platform has come... (CLICK ON IMAGE TO READ MORE)

        Self-driving vehicles are cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or “driverless” cars, they 
        combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle. Currently, there are no legally operating, fully-autonomous vehicles in the United States. There are, however, 
        partially-autonomous vehicles—cars and trucks with varying amounts of self-automation, from conventional cars with brake and lane assistance to highly-independent, self-driving 
        prototypes... (CLICK ON IMAGE TO READ MORE)
