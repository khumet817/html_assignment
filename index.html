<!-- Below is a basic introduction explaining what a science fiction movie is and what a tech talk is -->

        Science fiction film (or sci-fi film) is a genre that uses speculative, fictional science-based depictions 
        of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms, alien worlds, 
        extrasensory perception and time travel, along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft, robots, cyborgs, 
        interstellar travel or other technologies. Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or 
        social issues, and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition. In many cases, tropes derived from 
        written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific 
        plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held. Tech talks are short presentations 
        with community question and answer sessions. They are usually under an hour in length and focus on a specific technical topic.
